## 1) What this system is

Rift Haven is a class-based MMO experience built around quests, talent progression, resource gathering, crafting, rifts, dungeons, party play, and PvP arena support.

This wiki is written for players, not developers. It focuses on what to do, what matters, and how to progress efficiently.

## 2) Who should use it

- New players who want a clean first-session path.
- Returning players catching up to current systems.
- Group players planning dungeons, rifts, and class synergies.
- Crafters and economy players who want gold/profession loops.

## 3) Core rules (exact mechanics)

- Class level cap is 30.
- Talent unlocks happen every 5 class levels.
- Profession level cap is 100.
- Current launch paths are one active subclass per class:
- Fighter -> Fury
- Paladin -> Light
- Elementalist -> Sol
- Rogue -> Shinobi

## 4) Progression path

Recommended order:

1. Finish intro questline and class path choice.
2. Grab your class weapon quest.
3. Start town profession and utility quests.
4. Push class level 10 for your first major class quest.
5. Rotate quests, professions, rifts, and dungeons for steady growth.
6. Push class level 25 and complete devotion part II.

## 5) Rewards and breakpoints

- Class milestones: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.
- Profession milestones: 15, 30, 45, 60, 85.
- Rift contribution tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold.
- Dungeon ready checks and requeue windows can speed repeat runs.

## 6) Common mistakes

- Ignoring class weapon identity early.
- Delaying profession XP too long.
- Joining rifts late and missing contribution thresholds.
- Queueing dungeons without role/loadout prep.
