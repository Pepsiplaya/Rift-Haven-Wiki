## 1) What this system is

The economy covers gold flow, shops, buyback, auction trading, bank storage, and pet purchases.

## 2) Who should use it

- Players trying to fund gear progression.
- Crafters selling inputs/outputs.
- Traders using auction listings and claims.

## 3) Core rules (exact mechanics)

Main systems:

- Currency wallet (gold)
- Shop buy/sell with configurable multipliers
- Buyback queue
- Auction House listings and claims delivery
- Bank tabs/storage
- Pet shop purchases

Current defaults from config code:

- Shop sell multiplier baseline: 0.66
- Auction default listing duration: 12h
- Auction allowed durations: 12h, 24h, 48h
- Auction default max listings: 3 (tiered permissions can raise this)
- Bank default tabs: 1, max tabs: 8
- Pet shop entries currently priced at 250000 gold each

## 4) Progression path

1. Early game: quest + basic resource sales.
2. Mid game: profession output loops + targeted shop flips.
3. Late game: auction-driven item trading and claims management.
4. Long-term: pet unlocks, stash building, and liquidity for class upgrades.

## 5) Rewards and breakpoints

- Reliable gold starts with repeatable quest/profession loops.
- Auction becomes stronger once you can post consistently valuable items.
- Bank expansion and better inventory discipline increase run efficiency.

## 6) Common mistakes

- Overspending on convenience purchases too early.
- Listing weak items on auction and locking slots/time.
- Selling crafting bottleneck items before checking future recipe demand.
