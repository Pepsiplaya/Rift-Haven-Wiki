# Rifts

Back: [Home](../index.md)

## 1) What this system is

Rifts are timed world events with wave phases, escalating objectives, and contribution-based rewards.

## 2) Who should use it

- Players leveling through group combat.
- Players farming item/material rewards.
- Small groups that want repeatable event gameplay.

## 3) Core rules (exact mechanics)

Current global settings:

- Max active rifts: 3
- Spawn interval: 600-1200 seconds
- Rift telegraph warning: 25 seconds before open
- Spawn uses configured points and player proximity checks

Current rift tiers:

- Minor Rift (tier minor)
- Major Rift (tier major)
- Anomalous Rift (tier special)

Objective phases (when enabled):

1. Seal Nodes
2. Elite Hunt
3. Boss

Closing behavior:

- Rifts can close after boss kill (if configured on that rift).
- Rifts also have lifetime timers.

Contribution and reward tiers:

- Minimum reward eligibility: at least 1% of total contribution pool.
- Bronze: below Silver threshold.
- Silver: at least 33% contribution.
- Gold: at least 50% contribution.

Boss bonus rule:

- Boss bonus is awarded to highest boss-damage contributor.

## 4) Progression path

1. Join quickly after telegraph.
2. Prioritize staying active in each phase.
3. Keep pressure on objective mobs and elites.
4. Commit on boss to secure high contribution tier and boss bonus chance.

Current base roll profiles:

- Minor: Bronze 2, Silver 3, Gold 4
- Major: Bronze 3, Silver 4, Gold 5
- Special: Bronze 4, Silver 5, Gold 6

## 5) Rewards and breakpoints

- Higher contribution tier means more base item/material rolls.
- Boss winner gets extra boss table roll when available.
- Special/anomalous tier offers strongest baseline event rewards.

## 6) Common mistakes

- Arriving late and missing contribution thresholds.
- Focusing only on adds and ignoring objective phase transitions.
- Leaving before boss resolution.

## 7) Patch notes for this page
