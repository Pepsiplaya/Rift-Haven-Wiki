# Light Paladin

Back: [Classes Overview](../classes.md)

## 1) What this system is

Light Paladin is a front-line holy support that heals, shields, and stabilizes fights while still standing in melee range.

## 2) Who should use it

- Players who want support impact without staying far back.
- Groups needing sustain and defensive utility.
- Players who enjoy timing team cooldown windows.

## 3) Core rules (exact mechanics)

- Launch subclass: `Light`.
- Signature weapon family: clubs.
- Team-wide prayers and miracle tools define mid/late combat flow.

## 4) Progression path

3. Level 15: `Prayer of Protection`
