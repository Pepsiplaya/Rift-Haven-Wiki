- Players who want control tools and movement effects.
- Parties needing ranged pressure and area denial.

## 3) Core rules (exact mechanics)

- Launch subclass: `Sol` (internally under Elementalist/Steam path).
- Signature weapon family: staffs.
- Kit identity: bolt variants, gust control, meteor pressure, movement synergy.
