# Professions

Back: [Home](../index.md)

## 1) What this system is

Professions are your long-term account power loop for materials, crafted gear, and economy value.

Active profession skills:

- Mining
- Smithing
- Crafting
- Leatherworking
- Weaving
- Fishing

## 2) Who should use it

- Crafters.
- Economy players.
- Combat players who want self-made upgrades.

## 3) Core rules (exact mechanics)

- Profession level cap is 100.
- Recipes in current data: 166 total.
- Craft benches in current data: Armor Bench and Weapon Bench.
- Mining nodes in current data: 238 total.
- Mining node respawn buckets: 30s, 45s, 60s.

Mining node families in current data:

- Copper
- Tin
- Iron
- Thorium
- Cobalt
- Adamantite

Fishing quality improves with level, with higher odds for rare/epic/legendary catches as you level.

## 4) Progression path

Recommended progression order:

1. Start Mining immediately.
2. Pair Mining with Smithing early.
3. Add Weaving/Leatherworking if you build armor sets.
4. Add Fishing for extra XP/gold and consumable loops.
5. Add Crafting for ranged/weapon support recipes.

Milestone guidance:

- Mining: 1 (Copper/Tin), 15 (Iron), 30 (Thorium), 45 (Cobalt/Adamantite), 65 (Mithril), 85 (Onyxium)
- Smithing: 1 (Bronze/Copper), 20 (Iron/Steel), 40 (Thorium/Adamantite), 65 (Cobalt/Mithril), 85 (Ancient Steel/Onyxium)
- Fishing: better rarity odds as level climbs; whale chance slowly increases
- Leatherworking: Soft -> Light -> Medium -> Raven -> Heavy
- Weaving: Cotton -> Linen -> Silk -> Cindercloth -> Prisma

## 5) Rewards and breakpoints

- Early profession leveling reduces gear drought.
- Midgame profession levels unlock better value craft/sell loops.
- High-end profession unlocks become major gold and progression accelerators.

## 6) Common mistakes

- Waiting too long to start professions.
- Selling high-value crafting inputs too early.
- Ignoring required-level recipe gates.
