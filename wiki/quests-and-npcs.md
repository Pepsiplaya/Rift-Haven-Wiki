# Quests and NPCs

Back: [Home](../index.md)

## 1) What this system is

Quests and NPC dialogue drive most early and mid progression. This page is spoiler-light by default, with optional detail blocks.

## 2) Who should use it

- New players needing direction.
- Returning players re-routing progression.
- Group leaders coordinating class and side progression.

## 3) Core rules (exact mechanics)

- Current tracked quest file in repo lists 42 quests.
- Main onboarding runs through tavern/trainer/devotion chains.
- Class path has weapon quest + devotion followups.
- Quest interactions are NPC and objective driven (talk/kill/area/fishing/crafting style objectives).

## 4) Progression path

Spoiler-light backbone:

1. Knocking on Haven's Door
2. Meet the Trainers
3. Choose Your Devotion
4. Your class weapon quest
5. Town development chains (miner/farmer/weaver/blacksmith/quartermaster)
6. Mid progression chains (rift/arena/hive-related progression)
7. Class devotion II at higher levels
