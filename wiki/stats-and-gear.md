# Stats and Gear

Back: [Home](../index.md)

## 1) What this system is

Stats and gear determine your real power. Class level gives your baseline, and equipment/talents push your final performance.

## 2) Who should use it

- Players optimizing combat output.
- Crafters targeting efficient gear upgrades.
- Group players balancing offense, defense, and utility.

## 3) Core rules (exact mechanics)

Primary stats:

- Strength: physical damage.
- Agility: crit chance and dodge.
- Dexterity: movement speed.
- Intelligence: spell power.
- Constitution: max health and regen.
- Wisdom: healing effectiveness.
- Spirit: magic resistance and crowd control reduction.

Rarity tiers:

- Poor, Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary.

Armor type ladder:

- Cloth < Leather < Mail < Plate.

Armor class limits (max type by archetype):

- Fighter: Plate
- Paladin: Mail
- Rogue: Leather
- Elementalist: Cloth

Launch weapon restrictions:

- Fury Fighter: battleaxes
- Light Paladin: clubs
- Sol Elementalist: staffs
- Shinobi Rogue: swords

## 4) Progression path

1. Match your weapon type to your class path first.
2. Upgrade armor while staying within class armor limits.
3. Prioritize stat identity:
- Fury: Strength/Constitution
- Light: Wisdom/Constitution, then hybrid offense
- Sol: Intelligence/Spirit/Dexterity
- Shinobi: Agility/Dexterity/crit support
4. Replace low-level gear quickly once required-level upgrades unlock.

## 5) Rewards and breakpoints

- Hitting correct weapon + armor compatibility gives immediate power stability.
- Rarity jumps (Rare -> Epic -> Legendary) matter most on class-fit items.
- Midgame survivability usually comes more from right stat mix than raw item count.

## 6) Common mistakes

- Equipping high-rarity gear with wrong stats for your role.
- Ignoring required level checks.
- Building pure damage with no defensive baseline for dungeons/rifts.
