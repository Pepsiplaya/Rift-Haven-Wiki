This page answers common player questions and lists non-admin player commands.

## 2) Who should use it

- New players.

## FAQ

### Why can I not equip this weapon?

Launch class weapon rules are strict:

- Fury -> battleaxes
- Light -> clubs
- Sol -> staffs
- Shinobi -> swords

You may also be under required item level.

### Why did my armor get removed?

Armor is validated against class armor limits and required level. Invalid items are moved off equipped slots.

### Why did I get low rift rewards?

Rift rewards use contribution thresholds. Join early, stay active through all phases, and push boss damage.

### Why can I not queue dungeon right now?

You may be in a ready-check penalty window, have an invalid party state, or have a member below requirements.
