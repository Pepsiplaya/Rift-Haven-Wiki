## 1) What this system is

This page is your first 30-minute route so you do not waste time or pick a path blind.

Rift Haven starts with story quests, then opens your class path, class weapon, and town progression loops.

## 2) Who should use it

- Brand-new players.
- Returning players on fresh characters.
- Anyone helping a friend power through the intro.

## 3) Core rules (exact mechanics)

- You start with story-driven onboarding, not a random grind loop.
- Your class path choice controls weapon restrictions and early power.
- Class talents unlock at levels 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.
- Core controls to remember early:
- `F` interact with NPCs/objects.
- Left-click basic attack.
- Hotbar keys trigger equipped abilities/items.
- Open your settings menu if your keybinds differ.
- You can open key player UIs with commands (if permissions are enabled):
- `/quests` for quest log
- `/class` for class info
- `/skills` for profession progression
- `/stats` for stat snapshot

## 4) Progression path

First 30 minutes (recommended):

1. Complete `Knocking on Haven's Door`.
2. Complete `Meet the Trainers`.
3. Complete `Choose Your Devotion`.
4. Pick your class weapon quest:
- Fury Fighter -> `And My Axe`
- Light Paladin -> `The First Light`
- Sol Elementalist -> `A Bright Tomorrow`
- Shinobi Rogue -> `Ninja Tools`
5. Start nearby town chains:
- Miner/blacksmith path
- Farmer/weaver path
- Quartermaster and fishmaster/artificer side chains

Class quick pick:

- Fury Fighter: front-line bruiser, tanky melee pressure.
- Light Paladin: front-line support/healer with strong team utility.
- Sol Elementalist: ranged spell caster with control and burn.
- Shinobi Rogue: mobile sword/kunai burst DPS.

## 5) Rewards and breakpoints

- Early class quest completion gives momentum for level 10 devotion quests.
- Profession starts are strongest when begun early, not delayed to late game.
- Rift access and dungeon readiness improve sharply once class kits are online.

## 6) Common mistakes

- Picking class by theme only and ignoring weapon style.
- Skipping quest log checks and losing quest chain direction.
- Not learning your first class combo before joining group content.
- Selling everything early without checking crafting value.
