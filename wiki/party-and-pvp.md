# Party and PvP

Back: [Home](../index.md)

## 1) What this system is

This page covers party systems, group settings, and PvP behavior including arena world flow.

## 2) Who should use it

- Group players.
- Dungeon/rift teams.
- Players entering arena PvP.

## 3) Core rules (exact mechanics)

Party system highlights:

- Party creation, invites, leader controls, kick/disband/transfer.
- Invite mode options include normal, auto-accept, auto-decline.
- Party HUD/map/marker and ping support exist.
- XP and group systems integrate with party workflows.

Current party config defaults include:

- Max party size: 8
- Invite cooldown: 10 seconds

Party-friendly-fire rule:

- Party-vs-party-member damage is blocked when party PvP is disabled.

Arena highlights:

- Arena world defaults to `pvp`.
- Arena spawn protection duration: 3 seconds.
- Arena deaths trigger fast respawn teleport flow.
- `/arena leave` returns you to safe fallback/previous location flow.

## 4) Progression path

1. Learn party controls early (`/p`).
2. Run dungeons/rifts with fixed teammate roles.
3. Use arena sessions to sharpen class mechanics under pressure.
4. Tune party settings and invite flow to reduce downtime.

## 5) Rewards and breakpoints

- Coordinated parties clear content faster and safer.
- Better team consistency means better rift and dungeon output.
- Arena reps improve reaction and matchup knowledge for all modes.

## 6) Common mistakes

- Joining hard content without comms/role setup.
- Ignoring party PvP setting expectations.
- Burning all mobility/cooldowns before team engages.

## 7) Patch notes for this page

- Last updated: 2026-02-24
