# Classes Overview

Back: [Home](../index.md)

## 1) What this system is

Class choice defines your combat identity, weapon access, and talent options.

Current launch classes:

- Fury Fighter
- Light Paladin
- Sol Elementalist
- Shinobi Rogue

## 2) Who should use it

- New players choosing their first class.
- Players planning a second character.
- Groups building balanced party roles.

## 3) Core rules (exact mechanics)

- You have one main class and one active subclass path.
- Current launch-enabled subclasses are:
- Fighter -> Fury
- Paladin -> Light
- Elementalist -> Sol
- Rogue -> Shinobi
- Talent tiers unlock every 5 class levels up to 30.

Weapon identity (launch restrictions):

- Fury Fighter -> battleaxes
- Light Paladin -> clubs
- Sol Elementalist -> staffs
- Shinobi Rogue -> swords/kunai family

## 4) Progression path

1. Pick class in intro.
2. Complete class weapon quest.
3. Hit level 5 and choose first talent tier.
4. Hit level 10 and complete devotion part I.
5. Hit level 25 and complete devotion part II.
6. Finish level 30 talent tier.

## 5) Rewards and breakpoints

- Level 5: first meaningful specialization.
- Level 10: class identity starts to feel complete.
- Level 20-25: stronger mobility/control/defensive tools come online.
- Level 30: final tier adds signature playstyle finishers.

## 6) Common mistakes

- Ignoring class weapon type and building wrong gear.
- Taking talents with no synergy with your own playstyle.
- Not adapting for solo vs group content.
