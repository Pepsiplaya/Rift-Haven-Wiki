# Dungeons

Back: [Home](../index.md)

## 1) What this system is

Dungeons are instanced PvE runs with queue matchmaking, ready checks, scaling, and loot routing.

## 2) Who should use it

- Players who want structured group progression.
- Players farming repeatable combat rewards.
- Parties practicing role coordination.

## 3) Core rules (exact mechanics)

Queue/ready system:

- Ready check duration: 30 seconds.
- Ready check failure/decline penalty: 2 minutes.
- Requeue token window (disconnect-before-first-boss): 2 minutes.

Entry behavior:

- You must meet the dungeon's level band to queue consistently.
- If party members do not accept ready checks, queue progress fails.
- Leaving early can lock your queue flow for the penalty window.

General dungeon bands from current config defaults:

- Khaos (15-20)
- Khaos (20-25)
- Khaos (25-29)
- Dungeon of Fear I (30)
- Dungeon of Fear II (30)

Scaling model:

- Base NPC health/damage multipliers are per dungeon definition.
- Optional party scaling per extra player exists per dungeon definition.

Loot behavior:

- Loot routing is mapped per dungeon and loot-table configuration.
- Better clear consistency and boss completion improve repeat value over time.

## 4) Progression path

1. Enter with repaired loadout and class-appropriate weapon.
2. Do not ignore ready checks.
3. Learn each dungeon's pacing before speed-running.
4. Push higher band dungeons after hitting class talent breakpoints.

## 5) Rewards and breakpoints

- Level-band upgrades are the main dungeon progression reward breakpoints.
- Better consistency comes from clean clears, not reckless pulls.
- Queue reliability directly affects your total runs per hour.

## 6) Common mistakes

- Queueing underleveled or undergeared.
- Ignoring role readiness before accept.
- Leaving runs early and eating avoidable queue penalties.
