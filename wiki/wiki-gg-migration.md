# Wiki.gg Migration Guide

Back: [Home](../index.md)

## 1) What this system is

This page explains how to move this GitHub Pages wiki to Wiki.gg later without rewriting your docs.

## 2) Who should use it

- Server owners and content managers.
- Anyone maintaining long-term public documentation.

## 3) Core rules (exact mechanics)

Yes, it is possible to build this for Wiki.gg.

Current docs are written in portable Markdown with clean page split, so migration is mostly format/import work.

## 4) Progression path

1. Keep writing content in `docs/wiki/*.md` as source of truth.
2. When ready, create Wiki.gg project and import/copy pages.
3. Rebuild nav and templates in Wiki.gg style.
4. Update links to new canonical pages.

## 5) Rewards and breakpoints

- GitHub Pages gives immediate publish speed.
- Wiki.gg can later provide stronger wiki-native discoverability and category workflows.

## 6) Common mistakes

- Rewriting everything from scratch during migration.
- Mixing two source-of-truth locations too early.
- Migrating before content structure is stable.

## 7) Patch notes for this page

- Added migration-first workflow from GitHub Pages to Wiki.gg.
