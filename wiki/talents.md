# Talents

Back: [Home](../index.md)

## 1) What this system is

Talents are your class specialization picks. You unlock one talent tier every 5 class levels.

## 2) Who should use it

- Any player planning their class build.
- Group players coordinating team roles.
- PvP players tuning burst/control/survival profiles.

## 3) Core rules (exact mechanics)

- Talent unlock levels: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.
- You choose from the options in that tier.
- Current launch subclasses with full active support:
- Fury (Fighter)
- Light (Paladin)
- Sol (Elementalist)
- Shinobi (Rogue)

## 4) Progression path

Choose one of these planning styles:

- Balanced: one damage, one utility, one defense pick by tier.
- Group-first: pick support/control first, damage second.
- Solo-first: pick movement/sustain first, then burst.
